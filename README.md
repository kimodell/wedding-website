# Wedding Website :ring:

Wedding Website is a single-page application thoughtfully designed to provide guests with all the essential details for the big day. Guests can learn about the couple, explore the venue location using an interactive map, and conveniently submit their RSVP through a form that utilizes the SendGrid API to send responses directly via email.

The app is optimized for mutiple viewports, ensuring visitors can easily access all the information and RSVP from any device, whether on desktop or mobile.

Wedding Website was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and deployed using [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com).
